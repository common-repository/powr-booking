== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to create a POWr Account? =
Yes, you need a POWr Account.  Your account allows you to create and save plugins, edit them in your live page, and use them on multiple different websites.

= How do I add Booking to a page or blog post? =
Create and save the plugin in your WP Dashboard.  Then copy and paste the unique shortcode into any page or post. You can continue editing the plugin on your live page, in your WP Dashboard, or by logging in to www.powr.io.

= How do I add Booking to a theme? =
In your WP Dashboard, select Appearance > Widgets from the left sidebar. Find Booking under Available Widgets and drag it into a sidebar or footer.  Then visit the live page to set up the plugin.

= Can I add more than one Booking? =
Yes, absolutely!  To clone an existing Booking, paste the exact same unique shortcode into another page or post.  To create a new version, select Booking from the sidebar in your WP Dashboard and click Create New.  You can then edit and save a new version, and paste the new unique shortcode into a page or post.

= Will my users see the Edit button above Booking? =
No! You only see the Edit button because you own the plugin. To temporarily hide it, click on your page and then type 'p + down arrow' (the letter p followed by the down arrow). You can show the icon again by typing 'p + up-arrow'.
